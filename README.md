# Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals

A Coursera specialization offered by Duke University that is composed by 5 courses.

This specialization uses the libraries from the [Duke Learn To Program](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/). I decided to not use these libraries as an extra exercise; for example, insted of using the `getWidth()` property (from the Duke Learn To Program library, [you can read more about the documentation here](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course1/doc/)) in the week 2 of the first course, I used the [naturalWidth property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/naturalWidth) to get the witdh of an image.
